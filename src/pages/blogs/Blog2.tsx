                  In Makkah, there are several famous ziyarat (sacred sites)
                  that pilgrims often visit during their Umrah pilgrimage. When
                  traveling to these sites, many people prefer to use “Makkah
                  Umrah taxi” services for convenience and ease of
                  transportation.
